The business is scaling quickly, but the demand fluctuates a lot. This means that there are not enough usable bikes available on some days, and on other days there are too many bikes. If the company could predict demand in advance, it could avoid these situations.\n\nThe founder of the company has asked you whether you can predict the number of bikes that will be rented based on information such as predicted weather, the time of year, and the time of day.\n\nYou will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your steps, findings, and conclusions.","metadata":{},"id":"5a0a52d9","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"varInspector":{"cols":{"lenName":16,"lenType":16,"lenVar":40},"kernels_config":{"python":{"delete_cmd_postfix":"","delete_cmd_prefix":"del ","library":"var_list.py","varRefreshCmd":"print(var_dic_list())"},"r":{"delete_cmd_postfix":") ","delete_cmd_prefix":"rm(","library":"var_list.r","varRefreshCmd":"cat(var_dic_list()) "}},"types_to_exclude":["module","function","builtin_function_or_method","instance","_Feature"],"window_display":false},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
